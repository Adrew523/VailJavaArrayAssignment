# VailJavaArrayAssignment
1) First check for negative values of positionsToRotate.
2) Calculate the effective number of rotations by taking the modulus of positionsToRotate with the array length.
3) Create a new array rotatedArray to store the rotated elements.
4) Use a for loop to iterate through the original array and calculate the new position for each element based on the effective number of rotations.
5) print the rotated array.

You can change the value of positionsToRotate to specify how many positions you want to rotate the array to the left.
